# Sudoku-Solver
This code is a solution to the popular puzzle game Sudoku. The function solve() takes in a 9x9 grid representing a Sudoku puzzle and returns True if a solution exists, False otherwise. If a solution exists, the function will also modify the input grid to contain the solution.

## Requirements
This code was written and tested in Python 3.9.5 It should work with other versions of Python 3 as well. This code requires the following Python modules:

* random: For generating random numbers.

* itertools: For generating combinations of indices.

## How to use?
Here is an example of how to use these functions to generate and solve a Sudoku puzzle:

```python
import itertools
import random

from sudoku import generate_sudoku_grid, solve

# generate a random Sudoku grid
grid = generate_sudoku_grid()

#print the generated Sudoku grid
for i in grid:
  print(i)

# solve the grid
solution = solve_sudoku(grid)

# print the solution
for row in solution:
  print(row)


  ```
## Explanation
This code defines a function generate_sudoku_grid() that generates a 9x9 Sudoku grid with a random number of empty cells. The function first creates a 9x9 grid filled with random integers between 1 and 9 and then replaces a random number of cells with 0 to create empty cells.

The function is_valid() takes in a grid, a value, and the row and column indices of a cell in the grid, and returns True if the value is a valid choice for the cell, False otherwise. It checks if the value appears in the same row, column, or 3x3 square as the cell.

The function solve() is a recursive function that tries to solve the given Sudoku puzzle. It starts by looping through each cell in the grid, and if it finds an empty cell, it tries to fill it with a value from 1 to 9. For each value, it checks if it is valid for the cell using the is_valid() function. If the value is valid, it fills the cell with the value and calls solve() recursively to try to solve the rest of the puzzle. If solve() returns True, it means that a solution was found and the function returns True. If solve() returns False, it means that the current value is not valid, so the function sets the cell back to 0 and tries the next value. If all values have been tried and none of them is valid, the function returns False. If no empty cells are found, it means that the puzzle is solved and the function returns True.

## Limitations
This Sudoku solver is a basic implementation and may not be able to solve all puzzles. It uses a recursive approach to try all possible values for empty cells and backtracks when it reaches a dead end. This can be computationally expensive for very difficult puzzles.

## Areas of improvement

There are several techniques that can be used to solve more difficult Sudoku puzzles, some of which are more efficient than the recursive approach used in the code provided. Here are a few examples:

* Single position: If a cell has only one possible value, it can be filled in immediately.
* Single possibility: If a certain digit can only be placed in one cell within a row, column, or block, it can be filled in immediately.
* Naked pairs/triples: If there are two or three cells in a row, column, or block that can only be filled with the same two or three digits, these digits can be eliminated from the rest of the cells in that row, column, or block.
* Hidden pairs/triples: If there are two or three digits that can only be placed in two or three cells within a row, column, or block, the other digits can be eliminated from those cells.
* Pointing pairs/triples: If there are two or three cells in a row or column that can only be filled with the same two or three digits, and these cells are in the same block, the other digits can be eliminated from the rest of the cells in that block.
* X-wing: If there are two rows or columns that have only two cells that can be filled with the same digit, and these cells are in the same block, the digit can be eliminated from the rest of the cells in that block.


By using a combination of these techniques and applying them in the appropriate order, it is possible to solve more difficult Sudoku puzzles efficiently.
